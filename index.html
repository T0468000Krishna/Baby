    <h2>1. Career Aspirations and Required Skills</h2>
    <p>I want to become a software developer in future. I enjoy coding and making small websites and apps. After watching industry lectures and reading Prospects.ac.uk, I understand I need many skills for this role. This include programming (like JavaScript or Python), using Git, working in team, and understanding users (UI/UX).</p>
    <p>Also, soft skills like communication and time management are very important. Many guest speakers talk about working in Agile teams and doing regular meetings. I want to be part of that kind of environment.</p>
